Quickly Add Namespace Prefixes to SFDC Meta-data Source-code

Namespace Prefixes are required for ALL managed packages on the SFDC platform.

All webservice package references must reference a namespace prefix for 
deployed code to correctly reference installed packages.

References to custom objects must reference a namespace prefix in API calls:

NSP1__MyCustomObject__c

Managed packages on the SFDC Platform cannot rename/remove member classes, 
custom objects, visualforce pages, etc. Therefore, a namingConventions.txt
file will also be run on each individaul file to help users develop a 
generic copy of the code in non-managed package developer orgs, to have
classnames and org methods updated.

Format of: namingConventions.txt 

OriginalNameString:PackagedNameString

Example:

OriginalNameString.cls --> PackagedNameString.cls

-and-

public OriginalNameString(){ //... } --> public PackageNameString(){ //... }

11/30/2011 - Created Github repo, started construction of methods.

12/8/2011 - Added a 2nd script that was more targeted at JUST replacing namespaces (the first one became too focused on)
doing one-off replacements to keep legacy class definitions from changing in packaged code.

namespace_main.rb tags a list of object definitions: ObjectDef__c,Field1__c,Field2__c etc.,
